- Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
- Have **at least** three models on the backend, that include the following:
  - At least two one-to-many relationships.
  - At least one reciprocal many-to-many relationship (implemented by using 2
    has-many-through relationships). **Note:** in order to accomplish this, your project must include a joins table. This joins table must include a user
    submittable attribute.
  - Full CRUD actions for at least one resource.
  - Minimum of create and read actions for EACH resource.
- Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. Be sure
   to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate
   between routes.
- Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. A user
  must be able to:
  - sign up with a new user account,
  - log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in
    the session hash, and
  - log out of the site.
